# Project: TaldykNews
## Description
A platform for a news site with the ability to perform CRUD operations on articles and add new authors. 
- Articles are divided into categories, which list can be expanded if necessary.
- Authors are registered by the main site administrator.
## Sidenotes
My first independent project and the first project used large framework. A small web platform that implements CRUD operations for my college course. This job gave me an understanding of working with MVC, ORM (EntityFramework for the most part), cookies, DI, REST and HTTP requests.
The repository was created retroactively. There are a lot of things here that I would redo now, but I will leave them as a reminder and look towards newer projects.
