This project marks my first independent endeavor and my introduction to using a substantial framework. It's essentially a small web platform that implements CRUD operations, created as part of my college course. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with concepts like MVC, ORM (primarily EntityFramework), cookies, dependency injection (DI), REST, and HTTP requests.
